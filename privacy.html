              that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Thor Website
              and/or the Services and your account on a Third-Party Service. The
              use of this functionality may involve the third-party site
              providing information to us or us providing information to that
              Third Party. For example, we may provide links on the Thor Website
              to facilitate sending a communication from the Thor Website or we
              may use third parties to facilitate emails or postings to social
              media (like a ‚ÄúShare‚Äù or ‚ÄúForward‚Äù button). We also may provide
              links to allow third parties to process credit card and/or
              electronic payments. These third parties may retain any
              information used or provided in any such communications or
              activities and these third parties' practices are not subject to
              our Privacy Policy. We may not control or have access to your

              Third-Party Services, you are using their services and not our
